## Project Objective

To create a site to view the exchange rate between currencies around the world.

This was completed over two days in a teams of three in Week 5 of the Founders and Coders bootcamp.

I was built with vanilla JS, with a front end served to the client from the server, which used a currency coverter API.

The app has a limit of 100 API calls per hour, so please show restraint.

To view the project locally, please clone with repository.
